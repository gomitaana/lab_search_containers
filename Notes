Solve the problem using three different algorithms. For each of these algorithms, create a script to run them. These scripts should have the name in bold:
bfs: Breadth First Search
dfs: Depth First Search
A* search
a_star_cons: Using a consistent heuristic of your choice
a_star_incons: Using a non-consistent heuristic of your choice
